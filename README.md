# Capstone-App-Backend
Backend code for my Capstone App. Find frontend here https://github.com/mattpassarelli/Capstone-Service-Exchange-App

Completely had to redo my backend because I hated the idea of a Node based server, especially when I have *slight* experience with python and pymongo for MongoDB

To run:
    Prereqs:
        Make sure Python 3+ is installed
    1) in this main fodler, run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    2) then just run "python main.py" for the server to start
