# Capstone-App-Backend
Backend code for my Capstone App. Find frontend here https://github.com/mattpassarelli/Capstone-Service-Exchange-App

For now: To get this up and running

1) Run "git clone https://github.com/mattpassarelli/Capstone-App-Backend.git"
2) Run "npm install" from the command line inside the directory you cloned to
3) Install MongoDB (if it is not installed already), start it
4) Run "npm start"

Optional
5) Run node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel-node.js populate.js from the command line to populate the database. Will be automated eventually
